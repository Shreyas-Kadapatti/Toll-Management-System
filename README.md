## 🛣️ Toll Locations

The system currently includes the following major Indian toll locations:

- Highway 101 North
- Interstate 95 South
- Route 66 East
- Pacific Coast Highway
- Golden Gate Bridg



## 📊 API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration


### Transactions

- `GET /api/transactions` - Get all transactions
- `POST /api/transactions` - Create a new transaction


### Toll Booths

- `GET /api/booths` - Get all toll booths
- `GET /api/booths/:id` - Get specific toll booth details
- `PUT /api/booths/:id` - Update toll booth information


## 🔗 Blockchain Integration

The system uses a simulated blockchain for demonstration purposes, with the following features:

- **Transaction Hashing** - Each transaction receives a unique hash
- **Block Creation** - Transactions are grouped into blocks
- **Chain Verification** - Each block links to the previous block via its hash
- **Immutable Records** - Once verified, transactions cannot be altered


In a production environment, this can be connected to actual blockchain networks like Ethereum or a private blockchain.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

- **FASTag Integration** - Connect with India's electronic toll collection system
- **Multi-language Support** - Add Hindi and other regional languages
- **Mobile App** - Dedicated mobile application for drivers
- **Real Database** - Replace in-memory storage with MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- **Advanced Analytics** - Traffic patterns and revenue forecasting
- **Vehicle Recognition** - Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR)
- **GST Integration** - Automated tax calculations and reporting
